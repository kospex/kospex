# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

| Version | Supported          |
| ------- | ------------------ |
| 0.0.x   | :white_check_mark: |

**Note**: Kospex is currently in early development. Security updates are provided for the latest release only.

## Reporting Security Vulnerabilities

If you discover a security vulnerability in Kospex, please help us maintain a secure environment by reporting it responsibly.

### How to Report

- **Email**: [PLACEHOLDER - Add security contact email]
- **GitHub Security Advisories**: Use the "Security" tab in the GitHub repository to report privately
- **Response Time**: We aim to acknowledge reports within [PLACEHOLDER - Add timeframe, e.g., 48 hours]

### What to Include

- Description of the vulnerability
- Steps to reproduce the issue
- Potential impact assessment
- Suggested remediation (if available)

### Our Commitment

- We will acknowledge receipt of your report
- We will investigate and validate the issue
- We will work with you on coordinated disclosure
- We will credit you in our security advisories (unless you prefer to remain anonymous)

## Security Features & Practices

### Built-in Security Testing

Kospex employs multiple layers of automated security testing:

- **GitHub Secrets Detection**: Automatically scans for exposed secrets and API keys
- **CodeQL (SAST)**: Static Application Security Testing for code vulnerability detection
- **Dependabot (SCA)**: Software Composition Analysis for dependency vulnerability management

### Web Interface Security

- **Network Binding**: Web interface runs on loopback interface (127.0.0.1) by default
- **No External Access**: By design, does not listen on routable network interfaces
- **No SSL/TLS**: MVP does not implement SSL/TLS (justified by loopback-only operation)

### Data Security

- **Local Storage**: All repository data and analysis results stored locally in user's filesystem
- **Database Security**: SQLite database files stored in user-controlled directory (`~/kospex/`)
- **No Cloud Storage**: No data transmitted to external services by default

## Security Considerations

### Installation & Configuration

- **Default Installation**: Installs to user's home directory (`~/kospex/` and `~/code/`)
- **File Permissions**: User responsible for setting appropriate filesystem permissions
- **Configuration Files**: Stored in `~/kospex/` directory with user-level access

### GitHub Integration

- **API Tokens**: GitHub Personal Access Tokens stored in environment variables or configuration
- **Token Scope**: Recommend minimal required scopes for GitHub API access
- **Rate Limiting**: Respects GitHub API rate limits to avoid service disruption

### Dependency Management

- **Automated Updates**: Dependabot monitors and creates pull requests for security updates
- **Vulnerability Scanning**: Regular dependency vulnerability assessments
- **Pin Versions**: Critical dependencies pinned to specific versions in `pyproject.toml`

### Web Application Security

- **Input Validation**: [PLACEHOLDER - Document input validation practices]
- **SQL Injection**: Uses parameterized queries and SQLite-utils for database operations
- **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)**: Jinja2 templates with automatic escaping enabled
- **Authentication**: [PLACEHOLDER - Document authentication mechanisms if any]

## Deployment Security Recommendations

### Local Development

1. **File Permissions**: Set restrictive permissions on `~/kospex/` directory:
   ```bash
   chmod 700 ~/kospex
   chmod 600 ~/kospex/*.db
   ```

2. **Environment Variables**: Store sensitive tokens in environment variables, not configuration files:
   ```bash
   export GITHUB_TOKEN=your_token_here
   ```

3. **Network Access**: Web interface accessible only via `http://127.0.0.1:PORT` by default

### Production Considerations

⚠️ **Important**: Kospex MVP is designed for local development and analysis. Production deployment requires additional security measures:

- **Reverse Proxy**: Use nginx/Apache with SSL/TLS termination
- **Authentication**: Implement proper authentication and authorization
- **Network Security**: Configure firewalls and network access controls
- **Monitoring**: Implement logging and monitoring for security events

## Known Limitations

### Current Security Limitations

- **No Authentication**: Web interface has no built-in authentication mechanism
- **No SSL/TLS**: Direct HTTPS support not implemented in MVP
- **File System Security**: Relies on operating system file permissions
- **Session Management**: [PLACEHOLDER - Document session handling if implemented]

### Future Security Enhancements

- [ ] Web interface authentication system
- [ ] SSL/TLS support for production deployments
- [ ] Enhanced audit logging
- [ ] Role-based access controls
- [ ] [PLACEHOLDER - Add planned security features]

## Third-Party Dependencies

### Security Monitoring

- **Dependabot**: Automated dependency vulnerability monitoring
- **GitHub Security Advisories**: Receive notifications for dependency vulnerabilities
- **Regular Updates**: Dependencies updated regularly through automated pull requests

### Key Security-Relevant Dependencies

- **Flask/FastAPI**: Web framework security features
- **SQLite**: Local database with file-system level security
- **PyGitHub**: GitHub API client with token-based authentication
- **Jinja2**: Template engine with XSS protection

## Security Best Practices for Users

### For Developers

1. **Keep Updated**: Always use the latest version of Kospex
2. **Token Security**: Use GitHub tokens with minimal required scopes
3. **File Permissions**: Set appropriate permissions on kospex directories
4. **Network Security**: Keep web interface on loopback interface for local use

### For Repository Analysis

1. **Sensitive Data**: Be cautious when analyzing repositories containing sensitive information
2. **Token Management**: Rotate GitHub tokens regularly
3. **Local Storage**: Understand that analyzed data is stored locally in SQLite databases
4. **Cleanup**: Remove analysis data when no longer needed

## Incident Response

In the event of a security incident:

1. **Immediate Response**: [PLACEHOLDER - Add incident response procedures]
2. **Communication**: [PLACEHOLDER - Add communication plan]
3. **Remediation**: [PLACEHOLDER - Add remediation steps]
4. **Post-Incident**: [PLACEHOLDER - Add post-incident review process]
