# Krunner multi repository assessments - Sept 2025

## Overview

This document outlines concepts for multi-repository assessments in Krunner.

## Concepts

Run multipe assessments on the existing repositories. For the following reasons:
- To reduce repository sync time, run assessments post sync
- To enable re-runs, when the tooling changes (like metadata extraction using scc and panopticas)
- Run weekly or regular assessments or data summarisation

Initially, kruner was desiggned to point a directory, find all git repositories and then perform a function.


## Implementation
